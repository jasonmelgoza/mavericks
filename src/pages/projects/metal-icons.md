Over the years, I have tried all sorts of icon families and sets available online, but I consistently face the same issue: it's challenging, if not impossible, to find a comprehensive icon set that meets all my project requirements.

Sometimes you come across a fantastic icon set, only to discover that it's lacking a few essential illustrations. I've also had situations where I require an outlined version of a set or a different size. In all these situations it was another designer or design team applying rules and requirements taken from their project, their product or company brand.

I believe that for a product to appear unique and mature while maintaining a cohesive feel, it is important to have its own custom iconography. So, I've set out to start building my own icon setâ€”one that I can independently grow and utilize on projects I'm currently working on, and also rely on when I need to move quickly on an idea.

## The Design System

To ensure that my icons feel consistent and follow a unified style, I have drafted a set of rules and guidelines. These attributes serve as a foundation for designing the entire set. The rules cover various aspects including type, size, spacing, shapes, strokes, and corner radii.

### Type

Metal (for now) has two primary variations, `filled` and `outlined`.

### Size

Each icon has two sizes: large (24px) and small (16px). These sizes enable the use of icons in various design scenarios or components, such as buttons or avatars.
