"Basis" is our internal component library and design system at SecureDocs. We use it for designing and building new applications or features. When I first joined the development team in 2018, one of the first projects was to start a component library - something simple to start building out new features. At the time, the development team was transitioning major features to React. The opportunity to collaborate on a component library presented itself. We named this system "Basis."

## The Figma Library

As we started building with Basis, Figma made a breakthrough by introducing the shared library feature. This feature allowed effortless updates across multiple designs, adding significant value to the product.

## Building a Sandbox

While I was designing our Figma component library, the dev team adopted a popular open-source tool called "Storybook" for component documentation. Storybook streamlines the documentation and maintenance of components, reducing the overall workload. As the sole designer on the team at that time, Storybook proved to be immensely beneficial.

Another valuable tool included in Basis is called "Playroom," an open-source project by Seek. It allows me to quickly create mock-ups and easily share them with the team, along with sample code to reproduce the design. It has significantly improved my workflow.

Another essential element in the development of Basis is the component library called "Semantic React UI." During that time, we had limited options for finding a primitive component library to get the ball rolling. "Semantic" fulfilled all the requirements by offering fundamental elements like buttons, inputs, menus, and more.

Like any design system, Basis will never be truly "finished." I am always learning and seeking ways to enhance it. In early 2022, SecureDocs Inc. was acquired, giving me another opportunity to share this experience and knowledge with teams in our new, larger company.
