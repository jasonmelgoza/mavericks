When I joined SecureDocs in 2018, we discussed the design system early on. The SecureDocs development team was about to transition major features to React, providing an ideal opportunity to create a shared component library that aligned with components designed in Figma. Eventually, we named this system "Basis."

## The Figma Library

As we were building the core components, Figma introduced their shared library feature. This feature not only let us associate specific elements with each component but also made it easier to share changes and updates across different designs, which was a huge breakthrough at that time.

## Storybook & React

While building out our Figma component library, another tool gaining popularity was the open-source component documentation tool called "Storybook."
