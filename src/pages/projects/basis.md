When I joined SecureDocs in 2018 one of the very first things we started talking about was a designsystem.

## The Figma lib

Satoshi’s lowercase ‘a’ and ‘g’ are double-storied; however, single-storied alternates are available, through an OpenType feature. The fonts’ other OpenType features include 10 ligatures per font, as well as alternate versions of the ‘G’ and ’t’. The default numeral style in each of the fonts is proportional lining figures; three other styles of numbers are included, too. There are tabular lining figures, as well as numerators and denominators for typesetting fractions. The fonts’ lining figures have the same height as the uppercase letters. The lowercase’s ascenders are drawn to be slightly taller than the common height of the capital letters and numerals. Each Satoshi font contains ten directional-arrow glyphs, as well as six glyphs of circles, squares, and triangles. There is also a peace sign in the character set, a smiling-face emoji, a check mark, and two versions of the numbers one through nine, each enclosed inside of differently-filled circles.
