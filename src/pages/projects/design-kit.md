By 2013 RightScale was growing fast. Different teams were working on projects in isolation. As a design team, we saw the need to consolidate our processes and provide a single source of truth for product design.

What started as a shared color palette in a Sketch file ultimately grew into a design system we called ‚ÄúDesign Kit.‚Äù It included branding assets, color guidelines, an icon library, and a few selected UX patterns.

Along with a style guide, I designed and built component example pages that contained all the necessary markup and style for a given component. These pages were easy to share and were an excellent reference tool for front-end devs.

Building this system and sharing this knowledge was a priceless learning experience that would eventually direct me to my next role. In 2019 RightScale was acquired, which marked the end of my adventure there.
