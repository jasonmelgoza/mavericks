In 2018, I became SecureDocs' first UI Designer and worked closely with the engineering team. My primary objective was to establish a simple but effective design process for our expanding cross-functional team. It included developing prototypes for product development and constructing a comprehensive component library to support engineers in implementing new features.

One of my early projects where I utilized this process was redesigning SecureDocs's file-browser interface, an essential tool for our customers. It was a collaborative effort and a notable achievement for our small, cross-functional team.

Describle the main function and the different parts of the browser.

## Themeing

The SecureDocs application serves three markets, each with unique features and branding. To assist in marketing with the ability to promote three products without compromising the user experience, I developed a color-theming system for specific UI elements. This system allowed each product to have its distinct appearance while ensuring ease of maintenance.
