In 2018, I became SecureDocs' first UI Designer and worked closely with the engineering team. My primary objective was to establish a simple but effective design process for our expanding cross-functional team. It included developing prototypes for product development and constructing a comprehensive component library to support engineers in implementing new features.

One of my early projects where I utilized this process was redesigning SecureDocs's file browser interface, an essential tool for our customers. It was a collaborative effort and a notable achievement for our small, cross-functional team.

The main purpose of the file browser app is to serve as a centralized hub for customers to manage business documents, including contracts. We aimed to create a user-friendly interface similar to Microsoft's "[File Explore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Explorer)" or  Apple's "[Finder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_(software))," allowing users effortlessly interact with their documents with patterns such as drag-and-drop or contextual menus where they'd expect them.

## Developing Details

Designing and developing for "effortlessness" is a major challenge in product design. When building the file browser, we remained focused on a few key elements to ensure it felt "effortless" to the customer. One of those elements was the file browser's sidebar. 

## Themeing

The SecureDocs application serves three markets, each with unique features and branding. To assist in marketing with the ability to promote three products without compromising the user experience, I developed a color-theming system for specific UI elements. This system allowed each product to have its distinct appearance while ensuring ease of maintenance.
