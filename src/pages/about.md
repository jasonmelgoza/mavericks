#  Hello, I'm Jason

{% block className="block-lead" %}
I have always loved *design* & *technology* for as long as I can remember.
{% /block %}

In my teens I had a constant companion: my sketchpad. It was during those years I was consumed by comic books, captivated by the stories, layouts, and, most importantly, the art. The incredible works of illustrators like Jim Lee and Todd McFarlane intensified my enthusiasm for the craft. I would spend hours recreating their styles, using only the resources a teen in the 90s would have. Fueled by that enthusiasm, I enrolled in every available art class and eventually earned a degree in Art and Graphic Design from Fresno State.

While in college, my interest in technology grew. I no longer confined myself to video games; I had the opportunity to explore Apple computers and Adobe software. However, it was when I came across "Designing with Web Standards" by Jeffrey Zeldman, a book recommended by one of my professors, that my journey truly began. I devoured the book over a weekend and immediately delved into learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a personal challenge, I set out to build a website from scratch.

Over the past decade, I have developed a strong skill set that combines my design abilities with a passion for technology. Currently, I work at SecureDocs, Inc. as part of a cross-functional team. Our main focus is on building user-friendly, browser-based software. In my role, I primarily focus on developing our design system, assisting the engineering team with front-end development, and sharing my design knowledge with teams throughout the company.

Outside of work, I enjoy spending quality time with my wife and our two teenage children. We love traveling, trying new restaurants, watching the latest Marvel movies, and cherishing moments with our dogs. Overall, I am a passionate and dedicated creative professional who genuinely loves his work.

## About this site

I have been contemplating this project for some time, restarting it multiple times while acquiring skills along the way. The current iteration is developed using React and the excellent Next.js framework. For those who are curious, the project's source code can be found on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/jasonmelgoza/mavericks).
