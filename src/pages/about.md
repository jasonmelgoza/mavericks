As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a **designer**.
{% /block %}

From a young age, I've been captivated by art, design, and cutting-edge technology. Following my passion, I earned a degree in Art and Graphic Design from Fresno State.

Over the past 10+ years, I've built up my skills as a UI/UX designer and front-end developer. I've worked on all sorts of projects, from small websites to large-scale digital products. I'm constantly learning and pushing myself to create innovative and user-friendly designs.

Currently, I am part of an outstanding cross-functional team at SecureDocs, Inc., where we're laser focused on creating intuitive browser-based software.

Beyond work, I love spending time with my wife and our two wonderful ~~kids~~ teenagers. We enjoy traveling, trying new restaurants, watching the latest Marvel movie, and spending time with our dogs.

Overall, I'm a passionate and dedicated creative professional who simply loves what he's doing for a living.

## About this site

I've been thinking about this project for a while, restarting it several times but gaining some skills in the process. Personal websites like this should be places to learn and develop. This version is built with React and the fantastic Next.js framework - the project's source code is available on my [Github profile](https://github.com/jasonmelgoza/mavericks).
