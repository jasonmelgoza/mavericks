# {% $markdoc.frontmatter.title %}

Ever since I was a kid, I've been fascinated by art, design, and the latest technology. I pursued my passion by earning a degree in Art and Graphic Design at Fresno State.

Since then, I have built up my skill set as a UI/UX designer and front end developer. I have worked on a variety of projects, from small websites to large-scale digital products. I am constantly learning and pushing myself to create innovative and user-friendly designs.

Currently, I'm working at SecureDocs, Inc with an incredible cross-functional team, centering on building easy-to-use browser-based software.

In my free time, I love spending time with my wife and our two wonderful kids. We enjoy traveling, trying new restaurants, watching the latest Marvel movie, and spending time with our dogs.

Overall, I am a passionate and dedicated creative professional who loves building new digital products and solving complex problems.

## About this site

I've been thinking about this project for a while and restarting it multiple times. Personal websites like this should be places to learn and develop. This particular version is built with React and the great Next.js framework.
