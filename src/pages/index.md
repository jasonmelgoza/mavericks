Say Hi

To start modifying your site we suggest opening the Editor and modifying the Intro component. It's the component that powers the text you're reading.

To check out the full Read.cv API, take a look at the Documentation. It covers how to fetch and display your profile data.

Lastly, if you'd like to use custom fonts we suggest installing them as a dependency via Fontsource. We've included Inter in this project as an example.

If you ever get lost please feel free reach out to us about anything, we're here to help!
